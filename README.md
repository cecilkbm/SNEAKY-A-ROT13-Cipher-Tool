# 🔐 SNEAKY-A-ROT13-Cipher-Tool
A command-line Python project that implements the ROT13 substitution cipher, blending classic cryptography concepts with clean control flow, input handling, and a bit of personality.
This project was built to reinforce string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and defensive programming, while also acknowledging the reality that ROT13 is more fun than secure.

## ✨ Technologies
  - Python 3
  - Standard Library only
  - CLI-based interaction
  - ASCII art for UX flair

## 🚀 Features
  - Encrypts and decrypts messages using the ROT13 cipher
  - Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Preserves punctuation, numbers, and whitespace
  - Continuous input loop with clean exit handling
  - ASCII banner displayed at startup
  - Built-in easter eggs that detect specific phrases and respond humorously
  - Symmetric encryption (encrypting twice returns original text)

## 🧠 The Process
This project started as a straightforward implementation of a classic Caesar cipher variant, but quickly became an exercise in clarity and user experience.
Rather than relying on shortcuts or libraries, I implemented the character rotation logic manually to reinforce:
  - Alphabet indexing
  - Modular arithmetic
  - Explicit control flow
  From there, I added a banner and message detection logic to make the tool more engaging and interactive, proving that even small utilities can have personality without sacrificing readability.

## 🧭 How It Works
  - Each alphabetical character is rotated 13 positions
  - Uppercase and lowercase alphabets are handled separately
  - Non-alphabetic characters are passed through unchanged
  - The same logic handles both encryption and decryption

## 🎭 Easter Eggs
The program detects certain phrases and responds with cheeky messages, including:
  - Secret love notes
  - “This is not secure” acknowledgments
  - Caesar references
  - ROT13 self-references
  - Help/confusion prompts
These were added to practice conditional logic and keep the project fun and memorable.
